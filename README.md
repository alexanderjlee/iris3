# Iris

In Greek mythology, Iris (/ˈaɪrɪs/; Greek: Ἶρις) is the personification of the rainbow and messenger of the gods. She
was the handmaiden to Hera.

## What it does for you

Iris automatically assigns labels to Google Cloud Platform resources for manageability and easier billing reporting.

Each supported resource in the GCP Organization will get automatically-generated labels with keys like `iris_zone` (the
prefix is configurable), and the copied value. 
For example, a Google Compute Engine instance would get labels like
`[iris_name:nginx]`, `[iris_region:us-central1]` and `[iris_zone:us-central1-a]`.

Limitation: Iris cannot *add* information, only *copy* information. For example, it can label a VM instance with its
zone, since this information is known; but it cannot add a "business unit" label because it does not know what business
unit a resource should be attributed to. For that, you should label all resources when creating them, e.g. in your
Terraform scripts.

Iris is open-source: Feel free to add functionality and add new types of labels. See the `TODO.md` file for features and
fixes you might do.

## When it does it

Iris adds labels:

* On resource creation, by listening to Google Cloud Operations (Stackdriver) Logs.
    - You can disable this, see ["Deploy"](#deployment).
* On schedule, using a Cloud Scheduler cron job that the deployer sets up for you.
    - By default, only some types of resources are labeled on Cloud Scheduler runs.
    - This can be configured so that all resources are labeled. See `label_all_on_cron` below.

## Labeling existing resources

* When you first use Iris, you may want to label all existing resources.
* To do this, deploy it with `label_all_on_cron: True` and wait for the next scheduled run, or manually trigger a run.
* You may want to then redeploy Iris with `label_all_on_cron: False` to avoid the daily resource consumption.

## Supported Google Cloud Products

Right now, there are plugins for the following types of resources.

To learn from the code what resources and keys are added, search for `def _gcp_<LABEL_NAME>)`, i.e., functions whose
names start `_gcp_`.
The part of the function name after `_gcp_` is used for the label key.

* Compute Engine Instances (Labels name, zone, region, instance type)
    * Including preemptible instances or instances created by Managed Instance Groups.
    * Including instances used as GKE Nodes
* Compute Engine Disks (Labels name, zone, region)
    * Disks created with an Instance are not labeled on-creation. They are labeled with the Cloud Scheduler cron job.
    * The label indicating whether a disk is attached will change, if the state changed, on the cron job, not on-event.
* Compute Engine Snapshots (Labels name, zone, region)
* BigQuery Datasets (Labels name, zone, region)
* BigQuery Tables (Labels name, zone, region)
* PubSub Subscriptions (Labels name)
* PubSub Topics (Labels name, zone)
* CloudSQL (Labels name, zone, region)
    * These receive a label only on the Cloud Scheduler cron job, not on creation.
* Cloud Storage buckets (Labels name, location)
* In addition to these, project labels may be copied into each resource, if you have configured that in the
  configuration file.

## Installation

### Before deploying

#### Org and IAM

* You can deploy Iris in any project within your Google Cloud organization, but we recommend using a
  [new project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).

* For the first deployment, to set up roles and log sink. You will need to have these roles on the *organization* where Iris is deployed. These are not needed for subsequent deployments. 
    * *Organization Role Administrator* to create a custom IAM role for Iris that allows to get and set labels on the
      services.
      (Note that this is different from *Organization Administrator* and from Organization *Owner*.)
    * *Security Admin* OR *Organization Administrator* to allow Iris app engine service account to use the above role
    * *Logs Configuration Writer* to create an organization log sink that sends logs to PubSub

* To deploy Iris itself, you will need Owner on the project where Iris is deployed, or else these roles. (To deploy only Iris itself after the  org elements are already deployed, use `-p` as documented below.)
    * *Project IAM Admin* to set up the custom role as mentioned above.
    * *App Engine Admin* to deploy to App Engine.
    * *Pub/Sub Admin* to create topics and subscriptions.

#### Default App Engine service needed

App Engine requires a "default service" to exist (even though Iris runs as the `iris3` service).

If your project does not have one, just deploy some trivial hello-world app as the default service. (Having this service
online costs nothing.) Try [this](https://github.com/doitintl/QuickQuickstarts/tree/main/appengine_standard )
open-source that I wrote to do that as easily as possible; or else step
through [this tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/building-app) from Google.

### Deployment

* Get the code with `git clone https://github.com/doitintl/iris3.git`
* Have Python 3.9+ as your default `python3`.
* Install tools `envsubst` and `jq`.
* Install and initialize `gcloud` using an account with the [above-mentioned](#before-deploying) roles.
* Config
  * Copy `config.yaml.original` to `config.yaml`.
  * Optionally configure by editing the configuration files ([See more documentation below](#configuration).)
* Run `./deploy.sh <PROJECT_ID> `.
    * The above is the default. There are also command-line options, to be put  at the end of the command line after the project id. Run `deploy.sh -h` for documentation.
* When you redeploy different versions of Iris code on top of old ones:
    * If new plugins were added or some removed, the log sink *will* be updated to reflect this.
    * If the parameters for subscriptions or topics were changed in a new version of the Iris code, the subscriptions or  topics will *not* be updated. You would have to delete them first.
* If you are changing to or from  Cloud-Scheduler-only with or without `-c`, be sure to run both org and project deployments.         
*  See `deploy.sh` for configuring Iris to add labels only with  Cloud Scheduler and not on-creation, or without the Scheduler at all, or with both Scheduler and on-creation. The latter is the default.

### Configuration

* Iris' own config file `config*.yaml`
    * The configuration file may be `config.yaml`,`config-test.yaml`, or `config-dev.yaml`.
        * Which one is used:
            * If `config-dev.yaml` is present, that is used;
            * if not, and `config-dev.yaml` is present, that is used;
            * otherwise `config.yaml` is used.
        * Local vs App Engine
            * `config-dev.yaml` is not uploaded to App Engine and so is ignored there.
            * `config-test.yaml` and `config.yaml` are available for use in App Engine.
        * Copy `config.yaml.original` to the desired file name
        * All values in the `config*.yaml` are optional.
* `app.yaml` lets you configure App Engine, for example to set a maximum number of instances. See App Engine
  documentation.
* `cron.yaml` lets you optionally change the timing for the Cloud Scheduler scheduled labelings. See App Engine
  documentation.

## Architecture

* Iris runs in Google App Engine Standard Environment (Python 3).
* The Cloud Scheduler cron job triggers Iris at configured intervals. (See `cron.yaml`)
* For newly created resources, a Log Sink on the organization level sends all logs about resource-creation to a PubSub
  topic.
    * The Log Sink is filtered to include only supported resource types and, if so configured, to support only specific
      projects.
* PubSub topics:
    * One topic receives the logs from the Log Sink on resource creation.
    * The other receives messages sent by the `/schedule` Cloud Scheduler handler in `main.py`, which is triggered by
      the Cloud Scheduler.
        * Such messages are an instruction to call `do_label` for each combination of (project, resource-type).
    * A dead-letter topic
* PubSub subscriptions
    * One for each topic: These direct the messages to `/label_one` and `/do_label` in `main.py`, respectively
    * A dead-letter subscription. This is a pull subscription. By default, it just accumulates the messages. You can use
      it just to see statistics, or you can pull messages from it.
* IAM Roles
    * See the ["Before Deploying" section above](#before-deploying)

## Local Development

### Development tools

* Prerequisites for developing and building.
    * See [Installation](#installation)
    * Also, for development, set up a virtual env and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the server locally
    * Run `main.py` as an ordinary Flask application as follows:
        * To use the command-line,
          use `export FLASK_ENV=development;export FLASK_RUN_PORT=8000;export FLASK_DEBUG=1;FLASK_APP=main.py python -m flask run`
        * In an interactive development environment, run `main.py`, first setting these environment variables.
* For hands-on debugging
    * Set the projects you want to use in  `config-dev.yaml`
    * Use `test_do_label` and `test_label_one` and `test_schedule` to trigger against your localhost dev-server, to
      label actual Cloud resources that you pre-deploy.
        * See the `test_...` files for instructions.

### Adding new kinds of labels.

Iris adds about twenty kinds of labels. More can be added, but don't add too many. Billing analytics work best when not
swamped by excess labels. This is why GCP doesn't simply add these labels, and why Iris does not implement all possible
labeling, say by automatically copying all fields from each resource into labels.

#### Developing new labels for an existing resource type

To add a new label key to an existing resource type, add `_gcp_<LABEL_NAME>` methods (like `_gcp_zone()`) in the
relevant file in `/plugins`, following the example of the existing ones. Labels will be added with a key from the
function name (`zone` in that example), and a value returned by the function
(in our example, the zone identifier).

For example, you might want to add a label identifying the creator of a resource, or add the name of the topic to its
subscriptions.

#### Supporting new resource types

Iris is easily extensible with plugins, to support labeling of other GCP resources. Use existing files in `/plugins` as
examples.

1. Create a Python file in the `/plugins` directory, holding a subclass of `Plugin`.

   a. The filename and class name take the form: `cloudsql.py` and `Cloudsql`. That's lowercase and Titlecase. (Only the
   first character is capitalized, even in multiword names.)
   The two names should be the same except for case.

   b. Implement abstract methods from the `Plugin` class.

   c. Add `_gcp_<LABEL_NAME>` methods (like `_gcp_zone()`). Labels will be added with a key from the function
   name (`zone` in that example), and a value returned by the function
   (in our example, the zone identifier).

   d. For resources that cannot be labeled on creation (like CloudSQL, which takes too long to initialize),
   override `is_labeled_on_creation()` and return `False`  (though if you don't, the only bad side effect will be errors
   in the logs).

   e. For resources with mutable labels  (like Disks, for which attachment state may have changed),
   override `relabel_on_cron()` and return `True`. This will allow Cloud Scheduler cron to relabel them. (We label
   on-event only for creation events, so Cloud Scheduler is the way to relabel mutated state.)

   f. For resources where labeling must be skipped under certain conditions, override `block_labeling()` and return `True` where needed.

2. Add your API to the `required_svcs` in `deploy.sh`.

3. Add your Google Cloud API "methods" to `log_filter` in `deploy.sh`.
    * `methodName` is part of the logs generated on creation.
    * See examples of such logs in `sample_data` directory.
        * E.g., you can see a log sample for bucket creation, in file `sample_data/storage.buckets.create.log_message.json`. (Or create a bucket and look at the log.)
        * In that file you see `"methodName": "storage.buckets.create"`.

4. Add roles in `roles.yaml` allowing Iris, for each resource type, to list, get, and update (permission setLabels, for resources where it is available, or update where it is not).

### Testing

#### Integration test

* `integration_test.sh` creates a Google App Engine app and cloud resources and tests against them. See the file for
  instructions.
* It's an easy sanity check to be sure that, for example, that you have the right permissions.
* It works against two test projects that you specify.

#### Testing the Cloud Scheduler scheduled labeling

- This is less automated than `integration_test.sh`, so do it only if you have special need to test this functionality.
- Deploy some cloud resources like Cloud SQL instance. Or deploy an unattached disk and attach it.
- Configuration
    * Optionally edit the configuration file to set `label_all_on_cron: True` or `False`.
      `True` will cause all resources to be labeled on the Cloud Scheduler cron job, while
      `False` will cause only Cloud SQL and GCE Disks to be labeled.
    * Edit the configuration file to set `iris_prefix` to a unique value, so you can track the labels generated by this
      test.
- Deploy the app
    * Use the `-c` switch at the end of the line (after the project ID). This disables event-based labeling, keeping
      only the Cloud Scheduler cron functionality.
    * Trigger Cloud Scheduler from the App Engine GUI, and check that labels were added.
